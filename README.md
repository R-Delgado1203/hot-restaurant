# Hot-Restaurant

## Introduction

> Imagine, if you will, a virtual, online hub for a specific restaurant...and on this hub representations of tables and reservations. Enter Hot-Restaurant, a place where you can go (for this specific restaurant) and see currently waiting tables and to schedule a reservation for yourself, if need be. 

If a reservation is made - the data is saved in the "Current Reservations" section of the current list. If a reservation is made after the initial 5 spots of "Current Reservations" have been taken, the reservation is stored in the "Waiting List" section.
